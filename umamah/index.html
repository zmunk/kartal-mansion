  <div class= "p">
    <p>With a history that spans over more than a million years, 
      Palestine has played an important role in human civilization. 
      It is where society as we know it, the alphabet, religion, 
      and literature developed and come together to create the cultures 
      and ideas that we enjoy in our every day life.
      On your adventure through Palestine, you will enjoy many religious, historical, and archaeological sites. 
      However, Palestine has more to offer than just histoy.
      There are walks and hikes through beautiful valleys, along coasts, and through desert hills, towns, and ancient marketplaces. 
      The cuisine is nothing short of sumptuous and, most importantly, the warmth brought to you by the Palestinian hospitality will make you feel right at home.

      <h2> 1. Al-Aqsa Sweets </h2> 
      <blockquote>
        For those with a sweet tooth, Al-Aqsa Sweets is at your service. 
        This place is well known for inventing Palestine's staple dessert dish: Knafah. A stringy, cheesy, sugary desert unlike any other. 
        Al-Aqsa Sweets hero's this staple palestinian dish using semolina, cheese, syrup and nothing else. 
        When visiting Palestine, a trip to the country's cheesy capital, Nablus, is a must!

      <h2>3. Abu Salah</h2>
      <blockquote>
        Perched on the edge of Hebron’s Old City, this busy restaurant is one of the best for shawarma. Shredded lamb or chicken wrapped up in pitta with hummous, garlic mayo and some pickles. The perfect lunch on a hot day. 
        It has a handful of chairs where locals perch to chomp down on their pitas.

    Nabi Musa is the Arabic name for the Prophet Moses, who is recognized as one of the most important prophets in Islam, as well as in Christianity and Judaism. Maqam an-Nabi Musa has been the site of an annual pilgrimage since the time of Salah ad-Din. Set in an awe-inspiring landscape 20 kilometers east of Jerusalem, the shrine is a splendid example of medieval Islamic architecture. The shrine, mosque, minaret, and some of the rooms at the site were built in 1269, and successive additions were added in 1475.
